      <p>I think the perfection of love is that it's not perfect.</p>
      <p>The best and most beautiful things in this world cannot be seen or even heard, but must be felt with the heart.</p>
      <p>Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit.p>
      <p>The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.</p>
      <p>Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.</p>
